# Lightening CSS

A CSS framework that I can use for my projects inspired by the [CUBE CSS methodology](https://piccalil.li/blog/cube-css/).

## Features

### Incredible Flexibility

All settings can be changed with a global SCSS config file or a local CSS variable. That means you can easily override global settings on individual elements.

### Controlled Responsiveness

Responsiveness is important. But wouldn't it be great to control how columns and other layouts collapse/expand? This framework has multiple, responsive layout options to control that experience.

This includes the "columns" class which utilizes the Holy Albatross â€” effectively giving you "container queries" automatically.

### Performance Optimized

Every line of code is carefully considered. The framework is **modular** so you only need to use the code you need. It's also **incredibly lightweight** at just a few kilobytes gzipped and minified. It only uses selectors that browsers can **quickly parse and render**. And finally, state changes use data attributes. That means it's **purge css friendly**. No more needing to whitelist css styles.

### Enforced Accessibility

For styles to be applied properly, you need to use semantic markup. That means your HTML is forced to be screen-reader friendly. In the future, the framework will also enforce ARIA attributes where appropriate. That means if it looks right, it's accessible. No more needing to test accessibility elsewhere.

## Install

`npm install lightening-css`

> Note: this framework is not production quality yet. There may be bugs. Also, in the coming weeks there could be several changes that are not backwards compatible.

## Documentation

Coming soon when the framework is more complete and mature.
